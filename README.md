# Complete Blog System with Dashboard

This is a complete blog system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap as the fronten and NodeJs, Express and MySQL as the backend.

I made this as a technical demo and maybe in the future a open source system people can find use out of.

The demo is found under https://blog.enzominkoley.com/
